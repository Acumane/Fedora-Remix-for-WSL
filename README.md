# WLinux Enterprise Edition

**WLinux Enterprise is a Linux distribution for Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) that is compatible with the mainstream enterprise Linux vendor distribution.**

New and casual Linux users are strongly encouraged to obtain [WLinux](https://github.com/WhitewaterFoundry/WLinux) from the [Microsoft Store](https://afflnk.microsoft.com/c/1291904/433017/7593?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fp%2Fwlinux%2F9nv1gv1pxz6p) instead. WLinux includes end user support and [several usability modifications and tools](https://github.com/WhitewaterFoundry/WLinux#features), such as wlinux-setup, to improve the overall WSL experience for end users.

### For Enterprise

**WLinux Enterprise allows businesses, education, government, and other organizations to deploy a secure, reliable, and familiar Linux distribution on Windows Subsystem for Linux on Windows 10.**

**WLinux Enterprise was designed to be highly adaptable for secure enterprise environments and is compatible with the mainstream enterprise Linux vendor distribution and other derivatives.**

**Custom builds of WLinux Enterprise can be configured using standard Kickstart files to use internal package repositories and leverage other mainstream enterprise Linux vendor distribution security features.**

Businesses and other organizations who wish to license WLinux Enterprise, develop a custom build for their specific needs, and recieve ongoing support for WLinux Enterprise should [e-mail us](mailto:enterprise@whitewaterfoundry.com) or visit [our website](https://www.whitewaterfoundry.com/wlinux-enterprise-edition/) for advice, details, and a quote.

There are several approaches to deploying WLinux Enterprise on existing Windows 10 networks and Whitewater Foundry will work with your business or organization to develop a deployment, security, and support solution:

- [Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/apps-windows-10-app-deploy)
- [SCCM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sccm/apps/deploy-use/deploy-applications)

### Microsoft Store Build

**WLinux Enterprise is provided on the Microsoft Store on a self-support basis for advanced individual end users who simply need an enterprise compatible WSL distro. It adheres very closely to mainstream enterprise Linux defaults. The WLinux Enterprise build provided on the Microsoft Store does NOT include dedicated end user support, wlinux-setup, or the [usability features](https://github.com/WhitewaterFoundry/WLinux#features) that accompany WLinux.**

The WLinux Enterprise build provided on the Microsoft Store is derived from [Scientific Linux](https://www.scientificlinux.org/) an enterprise Linux rebuild sponsored by the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. A portion of the net sales proceeds from WLinux Enterprise on the Microsoft Store go to [Fermilab Friends for Science Education](https://ed.fnal.gov/ffse/support-us/index.shtml), a 501(c)(3) organization whose sole purpose is to support K-12 education programs offered by Fermilab.
